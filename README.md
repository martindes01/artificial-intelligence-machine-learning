# artificial-intelligence-machine-learning

## About

These are my revision notes for the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning module of the MSc Computer Science postgraduate course at the University of Birmingham during the 2020&ndash;2021 session.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

It is recommended to use [pdfTeX](http://tug.org/applications/pdftex/) to generate a PDF file directly from the source.
The pdfTeX extension is included in most [free TeX distributions](http://www.tug.org/interest.html#free).

### Installation

Simply clone the source from this repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/martindes01/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning.git
cd artificial-intelligence-machine-learning
```

### Files

- Main LaTeX file: [artificial-intelligence-machine-learning.tex](artificial-intelligence-machine-learning.tex)
- Compiled PDF: [artificial-intelligence-machine-learning.pdf](../../releases/latest/download/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning.pdf)

## Usage

To generate the PDF, run pdfTeX with the command `pdflatex` to use the standard LaTeX macros.
Two passes are needed to generate all features of the document.

```shell
pdflatex artificial-intelligence-machine-learning.tex
pdflatex artificial-intelligence-machine-learning.tex
```
